# Real Time Object Detection
This project deals with detecting an image and video object detection using yolov3 models. The yolov3 models are taken from the official yolov3 paper which was released in 2018. The yolov3 implementation is from darknet.Also, this project implements an option to perform real time object detection using webcam.
